# Constraint-Android
Constraint Lab3.1 <br>
Goal is to create the following picture. <br>
If it works correctly, when you move the “Name” TextView in design mode, all six boxes will move in concert. <br>
Some of the requirements are the following: <br>
• Turn autoconnect and inference off, manually add these constraints. <br>
• The image view will be constrained to the top of the view.  You can manually set a top margin. <br>
• Add any vector asset for the image view picture. <br>
• The Name box will be constrained to the bottom of the image view. <br>
• The other five TextView/EditText widgets will be constrained so that they move in unison. <br>
• Add a vertical guideline and use that as a constraint for the three right EditText widgets. <br>
• The Submit and Cancel buttons need to have a baseline constraint. <br>
• Show in the Text View that there are no red warning lines (for example for not having enough constraints). <br>
• Show in Design View that when you move the Name TextView, the other TextView/EditText widgets follow.  <br>
• Bring this layout up in an emulator to show that it is working. <br>
• Buttons do not need to be used. <br>
